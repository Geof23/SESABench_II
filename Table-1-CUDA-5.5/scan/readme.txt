Sample: CUDA Parallel Prefix Sum (Scan)
Minimum spec: SM 1.0

This example demonstrates an efficient CUDA implementation of parallel prefix sum, also known as "scan".  Given an array of numbers, scan computes a new array in which each element is the sum of all the elements before it in the input array.
