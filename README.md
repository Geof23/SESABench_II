# SESABench_II
This is a copy of PengPengHub/SESABench, with a centralized Makefile build/test system built in

You must set the environment variable 'CUDA_INCLUDE' to the location of the Cuda 5.5 sample include directory (if different than /usr/local/cuda-5.5/samples/common/inc/)

Also, the recomended way to run the tests is with 'make -j [num procs] -k
